## Thoughts
  This was my first game I've made that had any type of physics. I really like Jump King and I wanted it to be part of my learning experience. This is a near-perfect replica of Jump King. Various things are still missing like the extras and end-game stuff. I added a few things to make the game a bit easier which include: a checkbox to show hitboxes under the graphics menu and a flying mode triggered by pressing "C". The code is a bit messy and there are probably a lot of bugs, but this was my first time making a project this big. It was a lot of fun!
